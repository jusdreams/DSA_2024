Let’s learn how to divide a set of customers into categories, based on characteristics
they share. One of the most adopted approaches that can
be used for customer segmentation is clustering. Clustering can group data only “unsupervised,”
based on the similarity of customers to each other.
It will partition your customers into mutually exclusive groups, for example, into 3 clusters.

This is a step further than classification, now we will take in multiple similarities and build groups of data based off their classification similarities.
